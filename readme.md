**Summary and Documentation: Setting up a Node.js Microservice**

**Task 1: Set up the development environment**
- **Objective**: Install Node.js and necessary dependencies for building and running the microservice.
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Installed Node.js from the official website or package manager.
  - Used npm (Node Package Manager) to install any necessary dependencies, such as Express framework for building the microservice.

**Task 2: Create a new Node.js project**
- **Objective**: Create a new Node.js project and integrate the Express framework using npm.
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Created a new directory for the project.
  - Initialized a new Node.js project using `npm init` command.
  - Installed Express framework using `npm install express` command.

**Task 3: Design the API endpoints**
- **Objective**: Decide on the API endpoints for the microservice, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functionalities.
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Defined four API endpoints:
    1. `POST /api/add` for addition
    2. `POST /api/subtract` for subtraction
    3. `POST /api/multiply` for multiplication
    4. `POST /api/divide` for division
  - Each endpoint accepts two input parameters `num1` and `num2` in the request body.

**Task 4: Implement the API endpoints**
- **Objective**: Use Express to implement the API endpoints and handle incoming requests by performing the appropriate arithmetic operations.
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Created route handlers for each endpoint using Express.
  - Implemented logic to extract `num1` and `num2` from the request body.
  - Performed the respective arithmetic operation based on the endpoint (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
  - Returned the result in the response or handled errors appropriately.

**Task 5: Handle errors**
- **Objective**: Implement error handling to provide meaningful error messages to clients for invalid input parameters or other errors.
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Implemented validation checks to ensure `num1` and `num2` are valid numbers.
  - Returned appropriate error responses with meaningful error messages for invalid inputs or server errors.
  - Used Express middleware to catch and handle errors globally for a consistent error response format.

**Conclusion**:
- The development environment was successfully set up with Node.js and necessary dependencies installed.
- A new Node.js project was created and integrated with the Express framework.
- API endpoints for basic arithmetic operations were designed and implemented using Express routes and handlers.
- Error handling was implemented to ensure robustness and provide meaningful error messages to clients.

This documentation provides a detailed overview of the steps taken to set up and develop the Node.js microservice, including the design of API endpoints and error handling mechanisms.
